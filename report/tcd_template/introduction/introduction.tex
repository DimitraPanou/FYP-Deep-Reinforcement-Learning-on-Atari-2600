\section{Motivation}
Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in 2018 are subjects that are almost unique in their ability to permeate into nearly every sphere, community and space in today's society. From the research community to the business world and the public eye through extensive media coverage, ML is on everyone's mind. Prolific engineer and business man, CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX, Elon Musk has publicly shared his views on Artificial Intelligence AI being the biggest existential threat to humanity and calls for increased regulation. % CITATION NEEDED??

Reinforcement Learning is a branch of ML, that perhaps receives less media attention but is nonetheless set to revolutionize the field of AI.
